    "Client is an Asian restaurant group specialized in Chinese cuisine. Originated from Mainland China, it already has extended footprints around East Asia and earned its reputation on its artistic and fine dining experience. With a lot of tourists visiting them from oversea, it is decided to further expand their chain to North America. Client decided to pick a location among New York or Toronto, considered they are one of the most alive and populous cities in North America. They aim to have this flag ship restaurant to boost up their reputation further."

    "3.\tIt is preferred to avoid any similar kind of restaurant (i.e. Asian fine dining) around the area.\n",
